======== version history of Geo::EOP

version 0.11:

	Changes:

	- Geo::EOP is now fully based on a Geo::GML object.

	- version() and new(version) renamed to resp. eopVersion() and
	  new(eop_version) to avoid clash with GML version.

	- remove NS_GML* definitions from Geo::EOP::Util: get them
	  yourself from Geo::GML::Util.

	Improvements:

	- added eop spec 1.2.1 and tests in t/22eop121.t

	- added Geo::EOP::Envisat as demonstration implementation.  See
	  also examples/envisat.pl

	- use Geo::GML's version of xlink1.0.0

	- move schematron info from examples (which they aren't) into
	  a seperate directory.  Schematron information is not (yet)
	  supported.
