=head1 NAME

Geo::EOP::Util - EOP useful constants

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Geo::EOP::Util
   is a Exporter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Geo::EOP::Util ':eop11';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the namespaces used with EOP.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 Constants

All export tags defined NS_ATM_ESA, NS_SAR_ESA for EOP/HMA.

The constants have names which end with C<_ESA>, because I expect them
to move to the opengis name-space in the forseeable future.  Those new
names will not have the shorter constant name.

=head3 :hma10

Exports NS_OHR_ESA and NS_HMA_ESA as well.

=head3 :eop11

Exports NS_OPT_ESA and NS_EOP_ESA as well.

=head3 :eop12beta

Same exports as C<:eop11>

=head3 :eop121

Same exports as C<:eop11>
